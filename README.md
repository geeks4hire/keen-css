# Keen CSS
I'm Keen CSS. Built atop [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io), I provide a flexible framework for building a more legibile, pleasant, and beautiful user experience for [Keen IO](https://keen.io).

#### Installation
```
npm install
```

#### Development
To work on the project, simply run the following command and navigate to `localhost:3000` in the browser.
```
npm run dev
```
This will watch and build the `css` and `html` files and serve them with autoreload using [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/).

#### Building CSS
To quickly and simply just build the CSS
```
npm run build
```
